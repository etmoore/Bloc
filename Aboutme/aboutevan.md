Introduction
------
Hello, Oliver! I'm looking forward to our first session tomorrow.

A bit about me: I live in Colorado with my beautiful wife, Eileen, who teaches kindergarten. I've always been interested in the web, but about a year ago I decided that I wanted to make a career change and become a developer. Though I've enjoyed self-study, I believe I'll benefit tremendously from Bloc's apprenticeship model. I'm thrilled to have you as my mentor - Juline spoke of you highly.

I've included a mini-resume below to give you a sense of my background (as well as practice my markdown syntax). I'm eager to hear more about your background and why you chose to become a Bloc mentor.

Experience
--------
**[Voqal](http://www.voqal.org)**: *Director of Education Services* -  September 2012 to March 2014  
*Voqal is a nonprofit based out of Longmont, CO that engages in philanthropy to "build an educated, empowered, and engaged public." As Director of Educational Services, I had the priviledge of working on several interesting projects including [EducationOnDemand](http://www.eduondemand.org) and an upcoming YouTube series called "[Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse) Civics." While I enjoyed my time at Voqal, I ultimate decided to leave to immerse myself fully in my web development studies.*

[**TeacherMaps**](http://www.teachermaps.com): *Founder and CEO* - October 2012 to January 2014  
*My two co-founders and I created  instructional planning tool and social marketplace that allows teachers to create, organize, and share instructional materials with other educators around the country. As TeacherMapsâ€™ CEO, my primary roles were marketing, project management, and business development, but what I really wanted was to get my hands dirty in the code and actually build the product. I was a bit envious of my developer partners, and this convinced me to double my efforts to learn the craft of web development.*
